How will you test the changes?
- We use different environments to develop a application such as development, staging and production
environment. So We know first we need to apply changes in development environment and test all
the functionality working perfectly. Then we need to deploy in staging stage and simulate the actual 
user behavour and trafice. If this stage is also passed, then we will deplopy this in production
environment. If our monitor system shows any unusal activity then we will rollback our privious
version.

How will you ensure the changes don't negatively affect your cluster?
- Before we deploy our application we need to monitor our staging environment through
Prometheus and Grafana. If everything working fine we will apply a deplopyment stratgy
like blue-green and transfer some traffice in our new production environment and alwasy 
monitor our application. If monitor system shows any unsual activities, we will rollback or
if all working fine we will increase more traffic in our new production environment.
