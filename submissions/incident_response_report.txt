1. Incident commander name:
- Detect crypto miners using the Stratum protocol (falco-4sfth)

2. Executive Summary of what happened:
- Crypto miners needs havey cpu and gpu. In our cluster three crypto miners pod running and useing
most of our CPU.

3. Summary of what was affected:
- Our kubernetes cluster affected by three crypto miners pods that using our most of the cpu.
so if our cluster is hosted on cloud, it will generate high cost.

4. Summmry of the impact:
- Crypto miners need havey CPU. so if this pods runs long time, it will hampered our 
regular service and generate huge cost. 

5. Summary of the remediation steps:
- Our grafana shows havey use of cpu. and falco detected which pods took most of the cpu.
So administrator easily deleted this unauthorized pods and deleted it.

6. Summary of lessons learned:
- We need to restricting user to access our cluster and should restricting images to deploy
in our cluster. Also we need to always monitor our cluster health with grafana. We also need to 
add some alert using grafana to prevent un usuaul use of our cluster.
